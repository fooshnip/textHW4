To compare, we calculated the difference between characters using Simpson's distance. We then used multi-dimensional scaling to project the characters onto a two-dimensional space. The closer together two characters are, the more similar their speaking patterns are.</p>

                <p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-2">Most of the main characters were placed together on the left, with ancilliary characters spreading out along the right side. In the green circle, we have Woody and Buzz (the two protagonists) very close together. Additionally, many of Andy's other toys (such as Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Bo Peep, and Slinky) are in the cluster, along with Andy and his family members.
                  <br><br>
                  Sid, the movie's main antagonist, shows up in the red circle. Looking at the other characters in the cluster, it is likely that the underlying factor is the constant use of imperative commands ("Stop!", "Halt!", "Go away!", ...) as these characters tell other characters what to do. It also might explain why Woody and Buzz are closer to this cluster than the other characters in the green circle--as the protagonist, they are constantly making plans and directing other toys.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:16px; ">Lastly, we utilized sentiment analysis at the word level to try and get a feel for the moving flow of emotion during the movie.  We removed stop words, stemmed words to normalize the language, and we also removed punctuation.  We ran a moving average comparing movie text against a positive and negative sentiment word list.  Lastly, we applied a smoother to create a story arc to best capture overall trends in the movie.</p>
