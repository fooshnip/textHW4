                  <p style="font-size:16px; ">Using the raw text pulled from the scripts, we clustered the characters based on the type/content of language that they used throughout the movie. To compare, we calculated the difference between characters using Simpson's distance. We then used multi-dimensional scaling to project the characters onto a two-dimensional space. The closer together two characters are, the more similar their speaking patterns are.</p>

                <h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Takeaways!</h4>
                <p class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-2">Like the other two movies, we see that the primary factor for dividing characters involves the presence of each character--characters with prominent roles tend to cluster together while characters with only a few appearances tend to spread out in a line on the opposite side of the plot. In our main cluster to the left, we have the protagonists: Marlin, the focus of the movie; Dory, Marlin's sidekick; Nemo, the title character; and Gill, the father-figure who is the de-facto leader inside the fishtank. 
                  <br><br>
                  Just to the left of the main cluster, we have another smaller cluster that includes many of the fish inside of the fishtank. This makes sense because they are all experiencing the same subplot, and react accordingly to each particular situation. Additionally, they tend to talk about certain topics that wouldn't apply to the characters who are out in the open ocean. It is also mildly amusing that the three sharks in the movie (Bruce, Anchor, and Chum) are spread out just outside of this cluster, reminiscent of sharks circling their prey before they attack.</p>

                    <p style="font-size:16px; ">Lastly, we utilized sentiment analysis at the word level to try and get a feel for the moving flow of emotion during the movie.  We removed stop words, stemmed words to normalize the language, and we also removed punctuation.  We ran a moving average comparing movie text against a positive and negative sentiment word list.  Lastly, we applied a smoother to create a story arc to best capture overall trends in the movie.</p>
