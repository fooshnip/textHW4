ROOAAAARR!!! Were you scared?  Tell me honestly. I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it.  I think I'm just coming off as annoying. Well I didn't know we were supposed to have one already. What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's today?!  His birthday's not 'til next week!! But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. (panicked) Any dinosaur-shaped ones? They're getting bigger. We're doomed! Yes!  Yes!  We promise! Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?! It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!! Oh, no! Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come -- Woody?  Who's up there with you? (GASP!) Have you been replaced? Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends! Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur! Say!  What's that button do? And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but... Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do? Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew magnificently! With permanent ink, too! I thought he was at summer camp! Oh, no!  Not Sid! Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one of these again! He tortures toys -- just for fun. (GASP) Buzz! Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say something! (leaning down close        to RC) What is it, boy? (backing away) Oh, I don't like confrontations. (holding up an empty barrel) There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel. (yelling out window) Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm!        (beat) Oh, where could he be? Hey, you guys!  I think I've found him.  Buzz!  Is that you?! Whiskers!  Will you get out of here?!  You're interfering with the search and rescue. (whispering) Look!  They're home! Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?! You're kidding? Hey, look! (overly excited) He got it, Woody! Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go? Hey look!  It's Buzz! (muffled) Aaaah!  I need air! (relieved) Aa-a-a-a-ah!        (COUGH) I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel. (following Potato Head) Everyone else was picked. Are we there already? He's at it again! Great.  Now I have guilt.EXT. STREET/BACK OF MOVING TRUCK Take cover!! Oh!  It's time!

Man, the dolls must really go for you!        (aside) Can you teach me that? (walking past) Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh... Who is it this time? That ain't no happy child. He's sayin' that this was no accident. I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...        (pointing at Woody) ...by Woody. That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer! Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody? Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him.

Ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you idiot! Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using the old noodle. Yeah, alright!! Sorry there, old Spudhead. (sarcastic) Way to go, Rex. Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards! Oh yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where are you from? Singapore?  Hong Kong? What's with him? Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good! They must have kicked him out early this year. I don't think we should give him the chance. I got dibs on his hat! Tackle him!

I've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep. (into communicator) Terrain seems a bit unstable... (into communicator) No read-out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere -- HO-YAAAHH!!! (de-activating his        laser beam) Local law enforcement!  It's about time you got here.  I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit.  My ship has crash landed here by mistake. I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion? Watch yourself!! (continued) Halt!  Who goes there?! (to Woody) Do you know these life forms? Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace. Why, thank you...        (pulls away) Now thank you all for your kind welcome. I'll show you. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Well...no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.  As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.

(to Robot) Where's that bonding strip?! Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? Don't even think about it, cowboy! The air isn't toxic. How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!  My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets! You're mocking me, aren't you? Where? What's going on? I'd better take a look anyway. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? Sure is a hairy fellah. You mean that happy child? Well, then we've got to do something! I'm going to go teach that boy a lesson. Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous. I could have stopped him. Trouble?!        (looking around) Where?! Then we've no time to lose!! I don't see anything! What kind of a toy -- ? I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.

If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place -- Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy. Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet.  I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.        (pointing at Woody) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command. You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity.  Farewell. (continuing to walk away) Go away. Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Well, then let's climb abroad. Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit. Sheriff! (continued) Sheriff? There you are.  Now the entrance is heavily guarded.  We need a way to get inside. Great idea, Woody!  I like your thinking! (in burger container) NOW! (in container) Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is closing. (mouthing with burger box) Sorry. What a space port.  Good work, Woody. Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 -- You mean it has hyperdrive? Where is it?  I don't see the -- (continued) Spaceship. Greetings!  I am Buzz Lightyear!  I come in peace! This is an intergalactic emergency! I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12! (continued; to the aliens) Who's in charge here? (loud whisper) What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was -- Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling from here!  You're almost home.

(pause) Star Command, do you copy? (aiming his arm out        the pack) I've set my laser from stun to kill. Are you alright?        (whacking him on the back) I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A lesser man would have talked under such torture. (checking his wrist communicator) Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport -- Woody, we don't know what's out there! Shield your eyes! It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours -- Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that! Woody, stop it!!

I am Mrs. Nesbit!!        (hysterical laughter) (sober) I'm sorry.  You're right. (continued) ...I'm just a little depressed, that's all.  I can get through this. Oh, I'm a sham!! Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window! (continued) But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color... Years of Academy training...wasted!! I can't help.  I can't help anyone. Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference. No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.        (looking at himself) You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy. Yeah, right. But why would Andy want me? Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. Woody!  It's the moving van. ...almost        (GRUNT) ...there        (GRUNT) ... Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?! (loud whisper) Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of this thing! What?! Woody?!  What are you doing?! Woody! Thanks. Woody!  The van! Just go!  I'll catch up! Come on! You can do it, Woody. Hold on, Woody! NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!! (spinning) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...! Who-o-o-oa!  Woody! (pointing ahead) Look out!! Look out!! The batteries!  They're running out! Woody!  The rocket! Woody?!  What are you doing? You did it!  Next stop.  Andy. Not today! This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style! We're not aiming for the truck! Quiet everyone, quiet! (defensively) Me?  No, no, no, no...        (beat) Are you?
WOODY 
Reach for the sky. You're my favorite deputy. Somebody's poisoned the waterhole. (to himself) Pull my string!  The birthday party's today?! (to the room) Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear. Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky? Okay, thank you.  At ease. Hey, Slinky? No, Slink -- Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news. Sh-h-h-h-h!! (whispering) Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!! Be HAPPY! (to the room) Staff meeting, everybody.        (aside) Snake, Robot -- podium duty. Hey Etch!  Draw! (pretending to be shot) Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've been working on that draw.  Fastest knobs in the west. Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here? (unaffected) Oh, how ya doin', Rex? I was close to being scared that time. (choking) Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo. (blushing) Oh, hey - it was nothing. (very flustered) Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I... (grabbing microphone) Oh, thanks, Mike.        (to the crowd) Okay -- (to Mike) Oh, whoa, step back -- Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great. Everybody hear me?  Up on the shelf, can you hear me?  Great! Okay, first item today...oh, yeah. Has everyone picked a moving buddy? Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke.  We've only got one week left before the move.  I don't want any toys left behind.  A moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one!        (checking the pad) Alright, next...uh...oh, yes. Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion Awareness" meeting was, I think, a big success and we want to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you, Mr. Spell. Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note here...        (under his breath) Andy's birthday party's been moved to today.        (full voice) Next we have -- Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried. C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this. Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about. (continued) It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right?Everyone is now looking down, sheepish. Stay calm, everyone!! Uh, meeting adjourned. Alright!  Alright! (continued) If I send out the troops, will you all calm down? Okay, save your batteries! Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do. And this --        (turning on the baby monitor) -- is how we find out what is in those presents. Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job. This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet! A lunchbox?! Last present! So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about. No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around! Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me! There. Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry! (composing himself) Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake. Hey!  What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced. Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "Andy's Room" welcome. Hello-o-o... Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I frighten you?  Didn't mean to. Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody and this is Andy's room.  That's all I wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here -- Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot. Well, let's see, we've got double A's -- Yes.  They're Andy's toys. You'd think they've never seen a new toy before. It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks! All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy -- T-O-Y.  Toy. The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present. He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly -- Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly! No, you can't. You can't! Can't!  Can't!  Can't! Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it. That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style! Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. Finally! (looking back into        the toy box) Hey!  Who's got my hat? (sarcastic) Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!        (grabs the hat) Give me that! (nonchalant) Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who? Alright!  That's it! Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves. Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh? Oh, yeah, tough guy?! You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!        (to the room) Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear! Oh, no, no, no...        (pointing behind Buzz) Buzz, look!  An alien! Uh-oh. I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny? Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl. Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS. (redirecting Buzz's view) That's why.  Sid. No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot! THAT is Sid! Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt him with your scary laser. Buzz, I would love to see you try.        (gesturing to Sid's yard) 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater. (to himself) One toy? (whispering) Will Andy pick me? Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h! Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble! (pointing to the back        of the desk) Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz! Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep looking. Buzz!!! Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head? Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can explain everything -- Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident? Buzz! Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great! Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.  Huh? (weakly) Right?  Buddy? Oh.  Oh, that's good. No. Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of me?! Owwwww!!! (GASP) Andy?! Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?        (beat) I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy! You! (whispering) Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!! This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!! Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me -- (incredulous) WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?! YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure!!  You are a child's plaything!!! Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya looney! (to himself) Rendez-vous with Star Command. (to himself) Pizza Planet...Andy! Oh, no!  I can't show my face in that room without Buzz. Buzz!  Buzz, come back! No, Buzz, you've gotta come back. I found a spaceship! It's a spaceship, Buzz! Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home. No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there. (loud whisper) Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz! (loud whisper) Buzz! It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.  What an idiot! (using straw as periscope) Ow!  Watch where you're going! (to himself) Andy! Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it! Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf. (tracking Andy and family) C'mon, c'mon, that's it... Alright Buzz, get ready... Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket -- (loud whisper) Buzz! Dooh!  No!  This cannot be happening to me!! (to himself) This is ludicrous. Oh, no!  Sid!!! Get down!! (loud whisper) YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- (GASP) Buzz, NO! Hey!  What are you doing? Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you zealots! (to Alien) Will you be quiet?!!        (to both) You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out. (loud whisper) FREEZE!!! Not Sid's room...not there... We are gonna die.        (bolting out of the pack) I'm outta here! Locked!  There's gotta be another way out of here. Uh...Buzz?  Was that you? Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here.  Do you know a way out of here? (GASP!!) B-B-B-Buzz! Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death. I sure hope this isn't permanent. The door!  It's open!  We're free!! I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH! They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick! Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action! (to mutants) Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha! Back!  Back, you savages!  Back! Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled! (to himself) There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home... (muffled gasp) (pulling Buzz's hand away) Don't tell me what to do! YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!! (continued) Giddy-up partner!... (continued) ...We got to get this wagon train a movin'! You are a toy!  You can't fly! Oo-o-of!        (to the hallway) Buzz?!  The coast is clear.  Buzz? Where are you? (under his breath) Buzz! Oh, no! (high voice) Hannah!  Oh, Hannah! Buzz!  Hey, Buzz!  Are you okay? What happened to you? I think you've had enough tea for today.        (helping Buzz up) Let's get you out of here, Buzz. Snap out of it, Buzz! (loud whisper) Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz. Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius! (continued) Come on, this way! Hey guys!  Guys!  Hey! Hi! We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz? Boy, am I glad to see you guys! It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this! Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something! No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me! No, I'm not!        (to Buzz) Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead. (to Andy's toys) Just a sec. Buzz!  Will you get up here and give me a hand?! (insincerely) Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.        (exploding) This is serious!! (forced casualness) Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say "hello" to the guys over there? Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond! (shaking the arm's hand) Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man! So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?        (as BUZZ) You bet.  Gimme a hug. (continued; as himself) Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too. Nothing. No!  No, no, no, no! No, it's not what you think, I swear! No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here! Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please! Please!  Listen to me! (continued) No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!! BUZZ!! Go away, you disgusting freaks! Alright back!  Back, you cannibals! He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters! Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you! (continued) But -- but they're cannibals.  We saw them eat those other toys. Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you were gonna...        (laughs nervously) ...you know, eat my friend. Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's wrong? Sid!!! Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz, you're...        (GRUNT) ...get up... Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But don't blame me. Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz! Hey!  Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me. Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help. Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house. Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly. Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger. No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy. Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy. (continued; depressed) As a matter of fact you're too cool. I mean -- I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?  All I can do is... There's a snake in my boots! Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you?        (pause) I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket. Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You should get out of here while you can. Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were -- Yes Sir! (strained) Come on, Buzz!  We can do it! We've got to get out of here...NOW. C'mon, Buzz. (loud whisper) Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out! (nervous laugh) (punch-drunk) No, I'm fine...I'm okay... Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down! (out of breath; to himself) Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody, think! Guys! No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen! Please!  There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me.  I've gotta save him!        (pause) -- But I need your help. Please.  He's my friend.  He's the only one I've got. (to Babyface) Thank you.        (to the others) Okay.  I think I know what to do. We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody. All right, listen up.  I need Pump Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs? (continued; to Legs) You're with Ducky.        (to the others) RollerBob and I don't move till we get the signal.  Clear? Okay, let's move! Wind the frog! Wait for the signal. Go!! Alright, let's go. Lean back! (to toys in the bush) Let's go! Shhhhhhh! (loud whisper) It's ok.  Everything's under control. Reach for the sky!! This town ain't big enough for the two of us! Somebody's poisoned the water hole... Who are you callin' busted, Buster?! (continued) That's right.  I'm talking to YOU, Sid Phillips.  We don't like being blown up, Sid, or smashed, or ripped apart... That's right.        (beat) Your toys. From now on, you must take good care of your toys.  Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We toys can see... (continued) ...everything. (regular voice) So play nice. Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius. (to mutant toys) We gotta run!  Thanks, guys. Quick! Whew, I made it! (kicking Scud with        other foot) Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid dog!  Down!  Down! I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me! Buzz! Ah-hah!  There you are!! Ah-h!!  Ah-h!  No, no! No, no, no!  Wait!        (as Rocky spins him) Whoa-Whoa-Whoa...! No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!! No, no, no, wait! Well, thanks for the ride. Now let's catch up to that truck! We're almost there. (to Buzz) Speed up! Slink!  Hang on! (sarcastic) Great! The match! (continued) Yes!  Thank you, Sid! No-o-o!  No-no-no-no!  No-o-o! Hold still, Buzz! Ha-ha!! Wait a minute...I just lit a rocket. Rockets explo -- Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up! (covering his eyes) Ah-h-h-h-h!! Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!! Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!! Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck! Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!        (rubbing his neck) There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention. Say, isn't that mistletoe? Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you? (laughing) Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
ATTENDANT 
You talkin' to me? Just a moment... Yeah.
KID 
Buzz Lightyear responding!  Read you loud and clear! (into toy wrist communicator) On the way! Calling Buzz Lightyear. Wow! Total annihilation!
