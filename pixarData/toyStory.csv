19	ANDY	(pulling Woody's string) You saved the day again, Woody.
20	WOODY	You're my favorite deputy.
21	ANDY	C'mon, let's wrangle up the cattle.
22	ANDY	(raising his arms) Score!
23	ANDY	Wow!  Cool!

29	MRS. DAVIS	Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
30	ANDY	Okay.
31	ANDY	It's party time, Woody!
32	ANDY	Howdy, Little Lady!
33	WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the waterhole.
34	ANDY	(picking up Molly) C'mon, Molly.  Oh, you're getting heavy!        (to Woody) See ya later, Woody.
35	WOODY	(to himself) Pull my string!  The birthday party's today?!
36	WOODY	(to the room) Okay, everybody.  Coast is clear.
37	MR. POTATO HEAD	Ages three and up.  It's on my box. Ages three and up!  I'm not supposed to be babysitting Princess Drool.
38	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, Hamm!  Look!  I'm Picasso!
39	HAMM	I don't get it.
40	MR. POTATO HEAD	You uncultured swine!        (to someone O.S.) What are you looking at, ya hockey puck?!
41	WOODY	Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
42	SARGENT	(saluting) Sir!  No Sir!
43	WOODY	Okay, thank you.  At ease.
44	WOODY	Hey, Slinky?
45	SLINKY	Right here, Woody!
46	SLINKY	I'm red this time.
47	WOODY	No, Slink --
48	SLINKY	Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
49	WOODY	Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
50	SLINKY	Bad news?!
51	WOODY	Sh-h-h-h-h!!
52	WOODY	(whispering) Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
53	SLINKY	Got it.
54	WOODY	Be HAPPY!
55	WOODY	(to the room) Staff meeting, everybody.        (aside) Snake, Robot -- podium duty.
56	WOODY	Hey Etch!  Draw!
57	WOODY	(pretending to be shot) Oh!! You got me again, Etch! You've been working on that draw.  Fastest knobs in the west.
58	SLINKY	Got a staff meeting, you guys, come on, let's go!
59	WOODY	Now where is that -- ?  Aw, hey, who moved my doodle pad way over here?
60	REX	ROOAAAARR!!!
61	WOODY	(unaffected) Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
62	REX	Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
63	WOODY	I was close to being scared that time.
64	REX	I'm going for fearsome here, but I just don't feel it.  I think I'm just coming off as annoying.
65	WOODY	(choking) Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
66	BO PEEP	I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
67	WOODY	(blushing) Oh, hey - it was nothing.
68	BO PEEP	Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
69	WOODY	(very flustered) Heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, I...
70	BO PEEP	Remember, I'm just a couple of blocks away.
71	SLINKY	Come on, come on!  Smaller toys up front.
72	SLINKY	Hey, Woody!  C'mon!
73	MIKE	Ahem!
74	WOODY	(grabbing microphone) Oh, thanks, Mike.        (to the crowd) Okay --
75	WOODY	(to Mike) Oh, whoa, step back --
76	WOODY	Hello?  Check?  Better?  Great. Everybody hear me?  Up on the shelf, can you hear me?  Great! Okay, first item today...oh, yeah. Has everyone picked a moving buddy?
77	HAMM	Moving buddy?!  You can't be serious!
78	REX	Well I didn't know we were supposed to have one already.
79	MR. POTATO HEAD	(waving his arm out        its socket) Do we have to hold hands?
80	WOODY	Oh, yeah, you guys think this is a big joke.  We've only got one week left before the move.  I don't want any toys left behind.  A moving buddy -- if you don't have one, get one!        (checking the pad) Alright, next...uh...oh, yes. Tuesday night's "Plastic Corrosion Awareness" meeting was, I think, a big success and we want to thank Mr. Spell for putting that on for us. Thank you, Mr. Spell.
81	MR. SPELL	You're welcome.
82	WOODY	Ok, uh...oh yes.  One minor note here...        (under his breath) Andy's birthday party's been moved to today.        (full voice) Next we have --
83	REX	What?!  Whadda ya mean, the party's today?!  His birthday's not 'til next week!!
84	HAMM	What's going on down there?  Is Mom losing her marbles?!
85	WOODY	Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
86	MR. POTATO HEAD	Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
87	SLINKY	Hey, hey!  Come on, Potato Head! If Woody says it's all right, then, well, darnit, it's good enough for me.  Woody has never steered us wrong before.
88	WOODY	C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
89	REX	But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
90	WOODY	Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
91	WOODY	(continued) It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right?Everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
92	HAMM	Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
93	WOODY	Stay calm, everyone!!
94	WOODY	Uh, meeting adjourned.
95	HAMM	Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
96	MR. POTATO HEAD	I can't see a thing!
97	HAMM	Yessir, we're next month's garage sale fodder for sure.
98	REX	(panicked) Any dinosaur-shaped ones?
99	HAMM	Ah, for crying out loud, they're all in boxes, you idiot!
100	REX	They're getting bigger.
101	SLINKY	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
102	MR. SPELL	Spell the word "trashcan."
103	REX	We're doomed!
104	WOODY	Alright!  Alright!
105	WOODY	(continued) If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
106	REX	Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
107	WOODY	Okay, save your batteries!
108	HAMM	Eh, very good, Woody.  That's using the old noodle.
109	WOODY	Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
110	SARGENT	Yes SIR!
111	SARGENT	Alright men, you heard him.  Code Red!  Repeat: We are at Code Red! Recon plan Charlie.  Execute! Let's move move move!!
112	MRS. DAVIS	Okay, c'mon kids!  Everyone in the living room.  It's almost time for the presents.
113	WOODY	And this --        (turning on the baby monitor) -- is how we find out what is in those presents.
114	MRS. DAVIS	Okay, who's hungry?  Here come the chips.  I've got Cool Ranch and Barbeque --
115	MRS. DAVIS	Owww!  What in the world -- ?  Oh, I thought I told him to pick these up.
116	REX	Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
117	WOODY	Hey, these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
118	WOUNDED SOLDIER	(moans) Go on without me.  Just go!
119	SLINKY	A good soldier never leaves a man behind.
120	SARGENT	There they are.
121	SARGENT	(over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
122	WOODY	This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
123	SARGENT	(over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird. Alright...Andy's opening the first present now.
124	MR. POTATO HEAD	(chanting) Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato Head...Mrs. Potato Head...        (off Rex's look) Hey, I can dream, can't I?
125	SARGENT	(over monitor) The bow's coming off...he's ripping the wrapping paper...it's a...it's...it's a lunchbox!  We've got a lunchbox, here!
126	WOODY	A lunchbox?!
127	MR. POTATO HEAD	A lunchbox...?!
128	SLINKY	For lunch.  Heh heh heh...
129	SARGENT	(over monitor) Ok, second present...it appears to be...okay, it's bed sheets.
130	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who invited THAT kid?!
131	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:	
132	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, only one left.
133	SARGENT	(over monitor) Okay, we're on the last present now...
134	WOODY	Last present!
135	SARGENT	(over monitor) It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
136	HAMM	Yeah, alright!!
137	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, watch it!
138	HAMM	Sorry there, old Spudhead.
139	SARGENT	(to army men) Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
140	WOODY	So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
141	SLINKY	I knew you were right all along, Woody.  Never doubted you for a second.
142	MRS. DAVIS	Wait a minute.  Oooh, what do we have here?!
143	SARGENT	(indicating the baby monitor) Wait -- turn that thing back on!
144	SARGENT	(over monitor) Come in, Mother Bird, come in, Mother Bird.
145	SARGENT	(continued) Mom has pulled a surprise present from the closet.  Andy's opening it...
146	SARGENT	He's really excited about this one. It's a huge package.  Oh -- get out -- one of the kids is in the way, I can't see...
147	SARGENT	(from monitor) ...it's...it's a --
148	REX	It's a WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!!!
149	REX	Oh, no!
150	MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
151	HAMM	(sarcastic) Way to go, Rex.
152	WOODY	No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
153	HAMM	Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
154	WOODY	Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
155	ANDY	Let's go to my room, guys!
156	SARGENT	(into the monitor) RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  ANDY IS COMING UPSTAIRS!
157	WOODY	There.
158	SARGENT	(over monitor) Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
159	WOODY	Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
160	MR. POTATO HEAD	Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
161	REX	Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
162	FRIEND	Hey, look!  His lasers light up.
163	ANDY	Take that, Zurg!
164	FRIEND	Quick!  Make a space!  This is where the spaceship lands.
165	ANDY	-- and you press his back and he does a karate-chop action!
166	MRS. DAVIS	Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
167	ANDY	Oh, yeah!
168	MR. POTATO HEAD	What is it?
169	BO PEEP	Can you see it?
170	SLINKY	What the heck is up there?
171	REX	Woody?  Who's up there with you?
172	SLINKY	Woody, what are you doing under the bed?
173	WOODY	(composing himself) Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
174	MR. POTATO HEAD	Well, that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot, Woody.
175	REX	(GASP!) Have you been replaced?
176	WOODY	Hey!  What did I tell you earlier? No one is getting replaced.
177	WOODY	Now let's all be polite, and give whatever it is up there a nice, big "Andy's Room" welcome.
178	BUZZ	Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command.
179	BUZZ	Star Command - come in.  Do you read me?        (to himself) Why don't they answer?!!Just then, Buzz catches sight of his ripped packaging.  Thebox is designed to look like a spaceship.
180	BUZZ	(GASP) My ship!!
181	BUZZ	Blast!  This'll take weeks to repair!
182	BUZZ	Buzz Lightyear Mission Log. Stardate 4072: My ship has run off course en route to sector 12.  I've crash landed on a strange planet. The impact must have awoken me from hyper-sleep.
183	BUZZ	(into communicator) Terrain seems a bit unstable...
184	BUZZ	(into communicator) No read-out yet if the air is breathable... and there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere --
185	WOODY	Hello-o-o...
186	BUZZ	HO-YAAAHH!!!
187	WOODY	Aaaaaaah!  Whoa, hey, whoa, did I frighten you?  Didn't mean to. Sorry.  Howdy!  My name is Woody and this is Andy's room.  That's all I wanted to say, and also, there has been a bit of a mix-up. This is my spot, see, the bed here --
188	BUZZ	(de-activating his        laser beam) Local law enforcement!  It's about time you got here.  I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit.  My ship has crash landed here by mistake.
189	WOODY	Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
190	BUZZ	I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
191	WOODY	Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
192	BUZZ	Watch yourself!!
193	BUZZ	(continued) Halt!  Who goes there?!
194	REX	Don't shoot!  It's okay!  Friends!
195	BUZZ	(to Woody) Do you know these life forms?
196	WOODY	Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
197	BUZZ	Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
198	BUZZ	I am Buzz Lightyear.  I come in peace.
199	REX	Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur!
200	BUZZ	Why, thank you...        (pulls away) Now thank you all for your kind welcome.
201	REX	Say!  What's that button do?
202	BUZZ	I'll show you.
203	BUZZ	Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!
204	SLINKY	Hey, Woody's got something like that.  His is a pullstring, only it --
205	MR. POTATO HEAD	Only it sounds like a car ran over it.
206	HAMM	Oh yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where are you from? Singapore?  Hong Kong?
207	BUZZ	Well...no, actually I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4.  As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance.
208	MR. POTATO HEAD	Oh, really?  I'm from Playskool.
209	REX	And I'm from Mattel.  Well, I'm not actually  from Mattel, I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well, I don't really understand the financials, but...
210	WOODY	You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
211	BO PEEP	Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
212	BUZZ	Ah, ah, ah, please be careful!  You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
213	MR. POTATO HEAD	Hey, a laser!  How come you don't have a laser, Woody?
214	WOODY	It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
215	HAMM	What's with him?
216	MR. POTATO HEAD	Laser-envy.
217	WOODY	All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
218	BUZZ	Toy?
219	WOODY	T-O-Y.  Toy.
220	BUZZ	Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
221	WOODY	The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
222	MR. POTATO HEAD	Gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
223	REX	Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
224	WOODY	He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
225	BUZZ	Excuse me.
226	HAMM	Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
227	WOODY	Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
228	BUZZ	They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
229	WOODY	No, you can't.
230	BUZZ	Yes, I can.
231	WOODY	You can't!
232	BUZZ	Can!
233	WOODY	Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
234	BUZZ	I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
235	WOODY	Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
236	BUZZ	All right, then, I will.        (to toys) Stand back everyone!
237	BUZZ	To infinity and beyond!!
238	BUZZ	Can.
239	REX	Whoa!  Oh, wow!  You flew magnificently!
240	BO PEEP	I found my moving buddy!
241	BUZZ	Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
242	WOODY	That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
243	MR. POTATO HEAD	Man, the dolls must really go for you!        (aside) Can you teach me that?
244	SLINKY	Heh, heh, heh!  Golly bob howdy --
245	WOODY	Oh, shut up!  In a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
246	MATCH CUT TO:	
247	ANDY	Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
248	WOODY	Finally!
249	WOODY	(looking back into        the toy box) Hey!  Who's got my hat?
250	SHARK	Look, I'm Woody.  Howdy, howdy, howdy!
251	WOODY	(sarcastic) Ah-hah!  Ah-hah-hah!        (grabs the hat) Give me that!
252	BUZZ	Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog. Let me show you something.  It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture.
253	BUZZ	(continued) Your Chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me.
254	SLINKY & REX	Wow!
255	REX	With permanent ink, too!
256	BUZZ	Well, I must get back to repairing my ship.
257	BO PEEP	Don't let it get to you, Woody.
258	WOODY	(nonchalant) Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
259	BO PEEP	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
260	MR. POTATO HEAD	(walking past) Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
261	WOODY	Alright!  That's it!
262	BUZZ	Unidirectional bonding strip.
263	ROBOT	Mr. Lightyear wants more tape!
264	WOODY	Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
265	BUZZ	What are you talking about?        (to Robot) Where's that bonding strip?!
266	WOODY	And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
267	BUZZ	Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command?
268	WOODY	Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
269	BUZZ	Don't even think about it, cowboy!
270	WOODY	Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
271	BUZZ	The air isn't toxic.
272	BUZZ	How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet!  My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets!
273	WOODY	You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!        (to the room) Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
274	BUZZ	You're mocking me, aren't you?
275	WOODY	Oh, no, no, no...        (pointing behind Buzz) Buzz, look!  An alien!
276	BUZZ	Where?
277	SID	Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
278	WOODY	Uh-oh.
279	SLINKY	It's Sid!
280	REX	I thought he was at summer camp!
281	HAMM	They must have kicked him out early this year.
282	REX	Oh, no!  Not Sid!
283	SID	...Incoming!
284	MR. POTATO HEAD	Who is it this time?
285	WOODY	I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
286	LENNY	Right here, Woody.
287	REX	Oh, no.  I can't bear to watch one of these again!
288	WOODY	Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
289	SID	(plays under the next        5 lines) Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
290	BUZZ	What's going on?
291	WOODY	Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
292	BUZZ	I'd better take a look anyway.
293	BUZZ	Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
294	WOODY	(redirecting Buzz's view) That's why.  Sid.
295	BUZZ	Sure is a hairy fellah.
296	WOODY	No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
297	WOODY	THAT is Sid!
298	BUZZ	You mean that happy child?
299	MR. POTATO HEAD	That ain't no happy child.
300	REX	He tortures toys -- just for fun.
301	BUZZ	Well, then we've got to do something!
302	BO PEEP	What are you doing?!!  Get down from there!
303	BUZZ	I'm going to go teach that boy a lesson.
304	WOODY	Yeah, sure.  You go ahead.  Melt him with your scary laser.
305	BUZZ	Be careful with that, it's extremely dangerous.
306	LENNY	He's lighting it!  He's lighting it!
307	SID	NO-O-O-O-O!!!  CA-A-A-A-A-ARL!
308	LENNY	Hit the dirt!
309	SID	Yes!  He's gone!  He's history!
310	BUZZ	I could have stopped him.
311	WOODY	Buzz, I would love to see you try.        (gesturing to Sid's yard) 'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
312	BO PEEP	The sooner we move the better.
313	DISSOLVE TO:	
314	ANDY	To infinity and beyond!
315	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
316	ANDY	Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
317	MRS. DAVIS	Go wash your hands and I'll get Molly ready.
318	ANDY	Can I bring some toys?
319	MRS. DAVIS	You can bring ONE toy...
320	ANDY	Just one?
321	WOODY	(to himself) One toy?
322	WOODY	(whispering) Will Andy pick me?
323	WOODY	Don't count on it?!!  Doh-h-h-h!
324	WOODY	Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
325	BUZZ	Trouble?!        (looking around) Where?!
326	WOODY	(pointing to the back        of the desk) Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
327	BUZZ	Then we've no time to lose!!
328	BUZZ	I don't see anything!
329	WOODY	Oh, he's there.  Just, just keep looking.

335	RC CAR	(electric motor sounds) Whirrr!!  Whirrrr-whirrrr!!!
336	REX	Hey everyone!  RC's trying to say something!
337	REX	(leaning down close        to RC) What is it, boy?
338	RC CAR	(electric motor sounds) Whirrr!!! Whirrr!  Whirrrrrr!!
339	MR. POTATO HEAD	He's sayin' that this was no accident.
340	TOYS	Huh?

342	MR. POTATO HEAD	I mean Humpty Dumpty was pushed...        (pointing at Woody) ...by Woody.
343	TOYS	WHAT?!?
344	WOODY	Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
345	MR. POTATO HEAD	That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
346	WOODY	Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
347	SLINKY	We believe you, Woody.  Right, Rex?
348	REX	(backing away) Oh, I don't like confrontations.
349	SARGENT	Where is your honor, dirtbag?!  You are an absolute disgrace!  You don't deserve to --
350	MR. POTATO HEAD	Couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could ya Woody? Didn't want to face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy, so you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playin' with me more, Woody, huh?  You gonna knock me outta the window, too?
351	HAMM	I don't think we should give him the chance.
352	SARGENT	There he is, men!  Frag him!
353	MR. POTATO HEAD	Let's string him up by his pull- string!
354	HAMM	I got dibs on his hat!
355	BO PEEP	Would you boys stop it?!
356	HAMM	Tackle him!
357	WOODY	No, no, no, no!  Wait!  Wait I can explain everything --
358	MRS. DAVIS	Andy, c'mon!
359	ANDY	Okay, Mom, be right down.  I've got to get Buzz.
360	SARGENT	Retreat!
361	ANDY	Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
362	MRS. DAVIS	No, I haven't seen him.
363	MR. POTATO HEAD	Psssst!
364	MRS. DAVIS	Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
365	ANDY	But Mom, I can't find him!
366	MRS. DAVIS	Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
367	ANDY	Okay...
368	ANDY	I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
369	MRS. DAVIS	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
370	SLINKY	It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
371	REX	(holding up an empty barrel) There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
372	REX	(yelling out window) Buzz!  The monkeys aren't working! We're formulating another plan! Stay calm!        (beat) Oh, where could he be?
373	ANDY	Can I help pump the gas?
374	MRS. DAVIS	Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
375	ANDY	Yeah?!
376	MRS. DAVIS	Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
377	ANDY	(sarcastic) Yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, Mom.
378	WOODY	Oh, great.  How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident?
379	WOODY	Buzz!
380	WOODY	Buzz!  You're alive!  This is great! Oh, I'm saved!  I'm saved!  Andy'll find you here, he'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone that this was all just a big mistake.  Huh?
381	WOODY	(weakly) Right?  Buddy?
382	BUZZ	I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
383	WOODY	Oh.  Oh, that's good.
384	BUZZ	(getting in Woody's face) But we're not on my planet, are we?
385	WOODY	No.
386	WOODY	Ok!  Come on!  You want a piece of me?!
387	WOODY	Owwwww!!!
388	MRS. DAVIS	Next stop...
389	ANDY	Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
390	WOODY	(GASP) Andy?!
391	WOODY	Doesn't he realize that I'm not there?        (beat) I'm LOST!  Oh, I'm a lost toy!
392	BUZZ	Buzz Lightyear Mission Log.  The local Sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort --
393	WOODY	You!
394	BUZZ	(into wrist communicator) According to my nava-computer, the --
395	WOODY	(whispering) Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
396	BUZZ	Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
397	WOODY	This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
398	BUZZ	My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
399	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
400	BUZZ	Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
401	WOODY	(incredulous) WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
402	BUZZ	Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet.  I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness.        (pointing at Woody) And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendez-vous with Star Command.
403	WOODY	YOU ARE A TOY!!!  You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure!!  You are a child's plaything!!!
404	BUZZ	You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity.  Farewell.
405	WOODY	Oh, yeah?  Well, good riddance, ya looney!
406	WOODY	(to himself) Rendez-vous with Star Command.
407	PIZZA DELIVERER	Hey, Gas Dude!
408	ATTENDANT	You talkin' to me?
409	PIZZA DELIVERER	Yeah, man, can you help me?  Do you know where Cutting Blvd. is?
410	ATTENDANT	Just a moment...
411	WOODY	(to himself) Pizza Planet...Andy!
412	WOODY	Oh, no!  I can't show my face in that room without Buzz.
413	WOODY	Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
414	BUZZ	(continuing to walk away) Go away.
415	WOODY	No, Buzz, you've gotta come back. I found a spaceship!
416	WOODY	It's a spaceship, Buzz!
417	PIZZA DELIVERER	C'mon, man, hurry up.  Um, like the pizza's are getting cold here.
418	BUZZ	Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
419	WOODY	Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
420	BUZZ	Well, then let's climb abroad.
421	WOODY	No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
422	BUZZ	Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
423	WOODY	(loud whisper) Yeah, but, Buzz!  Buzz!
424	PIZZA DELIVERER	Ok, so that's two lefts, and then a right, huh?
425	ATTENDANT	Yeah.
426	PIZZA DELIVERER	Okay, thanks for the directions.
427	WOODY	(loud whisper) Buzz!
428	WOODY	It'll be safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay.  What an idiot!

436	BUZZ	Great idea, Woody!  I like your thinking!
437	ROBOT GUARDS	You are clear to enter.  Welcome to Pizza Planet.
438	BUZZ	(in burger container) NOW!
439	BUZZ	(in container) Quickly, Sheriff!  The airlock is closing.
440	WOODY	(using straw as periscope) Ow!  Watch where you're going!
441	BUZZ	(mouthing with burger box) Sorry.
442	BUZZ	What a space port.  Good work, Woody.
443	ANDY	Mom, can I play Black Hole? Please, please, please?!
444	WOODY	(to himself) Andy!
445	MRS. DAVIS	What's Black Hole?
446	ANDY	Oh, it's so cool...
447	BUZZ	Now we need to find a ship that's headed for Sector 12 --
448	WOODY	Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
449	BUZZ	You mean it has hyperdrive?
450	WOODY	Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
451	WOODY	(tracking Andy and family) C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
452	BUZZ	Where is it?  I don't see the --
453	BUZZ	(continued) Spaceship.
454	WOODY	Alright Buzz, get ready...
455	WOODY	Okay, Buzz, when I say "go," we're gonna jump in the basket --
456	WOODY	(loud whisper) Buzz!
457	WOODY	Dooh!  No!  This cannot be happening to me!!
458	ALIEN	(excited) A stranger!
459	ALIEN	From the outside!
460	ALIENS	Oo-o-o-o-o-o...

462	ALIENS	Tell us!  What is it like outside?
463	BUZZ	This is an intergalactic emergency! I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12!
464	BUZZ	(continued; to the aliens) Who's in charge here?
465	ALIENS	The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!!
466	ALIEN	The claw is our master.
467	ALIEN	The claw chooses who will go and who will stay.
468	WOODY	(to himself) This is ludicrous.
469	SID	(laughter)
470	WOODY	Oh, no!  Sid!!!
471	WOODY	Get down!!
472	BUZZ	(loud whisper) What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --

479	SID	Yes!
480	WOODY	(GASP) Buzz, NO!

482	ALIEN	He has been chosen.
483	WOODY	Hey!  What are you doing?
484	ALIEN	He must go.
485	WOODY	Stop it, you -- !  Stop it, you zealots!
486	ALIENS	He must go!  Do not fight the claw! Do not anger the claw!  He has been chosen.
487	SID	Alright!  Double prizes!
488	SID	(looking at his two        new toys) Let's go home and...play.  Ha-ha-ha.
489	MATCH DISSOLVE TO:	
490	BUZZ	Sheriff!  I can see your dwelling from here!  You're almost home.
491	ALIEN	Nirvana is coming!  The mystic portal awaits!
492	WOODY	(to Alien) Will you be quiet?!!        (to both) You guys don't get it, do you? Once we go into Sid's house, we won't be coming out.
493	SID	Whoa, Scud!  Hey, boy.  Sit!  Good boy!
494	SID	Hey, I got somethin' for ya, boy.
495	WOODY	(loud whisper) FREEZE!!!

512	HANNAH	Sid!  Give her back!
513	HANNAH	(pounding on his door) Sid!  Sid!...
514	SID	(as Doctor) Oh, no.  We have a sick patient here, nurse.  Prepare the O.R., STAT!
515	HANNAH	Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
516	SID	(as Doctor) Patient is...        (straining while        tightening vise) ...pre-e-epped.
517	SID	(as Doctor) No one's ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.
518	SID	(as Doctor) Now for the tricky part -- pliers!
519	BUZZ	(whispering to Woody) I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school.
520	SID	(as Nurse) Doctor, you've done it!        (running to the door) Hannah?
521	SID	(continued) Janie's all better now.
522	HANNAH	MOM!!  MOM!!
523	SID	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
524	WOODY	We are gonna die.        (bolting out of the pack) I'm outta here!
525	WOODY	Locked!  There's gotta be another way out of here.
526	WOODY	Uh...Buzz?  Was that you?
527	WOODY	Hey!  Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here.  Do you know a way out of here?
528	WOODY	(GASP!!)

530	BUZZ	They're cannibals!
531	BUZZ	May day!  May day!  Come in, Star Command!  Send reinforcements!...        (pause) Star Command, do you copy?
532	BUZZ	(aiming his arm out        the pack) I've set my laser from stun to kill.
533	WOODY	Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
534	REX	Hey, you guys!  I think I've found him.  Buzz!  Is that you?!
535	REX	Whiskers!  Will you get out of here?!  You're interfering with the search and rescue.
536	REX	(whispering) Look!  They're home!
537	ANDY	Mom, have you seen Woody?
538	MRS. DAVIS	Where was the last place you left him?
539	ANDY	(searching the van) Right here in the van.
540	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
541	ANDY	He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
542	BO PEEP	(GASP) Woody's gone?!
543	HAMM	Well waddah-ya-know, the weasel ran away.
544	MR. POTATO HEAD	Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
545	REX	Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
546	BO PEEP	Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay.
547	DISSOLVE TO:	
548	SID	(as Interrogator) Oh, a survivor.  Where is the rebel base?  Talk!
549	SID	(as Interrogator) I can see your will is strong.
550	SID	(continued) Well, we have ways of making you talk.
551	SID	(as Interrogator) Where are your rebel friends now? Heh, heh.
552	SID'S MOM	Sid!!  Your pop-tarts are ready!
553	SID	Alright!!
554	BUZZ	Are you alright?        (whacking him on the back) I'm proud of you, Sheriff.  A lesser man would have talked under such torture.
555	WOODY	I sure hope this isn't permanent.
556	BUZZ	(checking his wrist communicator) Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
557	WOODY	The door!  It's open!  We're free!!
558	BUZZ	Woody, we don't know what's out there!
559	WOODY	I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!

566	WOODY	Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
567	BUZZ	Woody, stop it!!
568	WOODY	Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
569	WOODY	(to himself) There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home...
570	WOODY	(muffled gasp)
571	BUZZ	(whisper) Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
572	WOODY	(pulling Buzz's hand away) Don't tell me what to do!
573	BUZZ	Shhh!
574	WOODY	YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA!!

667	WOODY	Buzz!  Will you get up here and give me a hand?!
668	WOODY	(insincerely) Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.        (exploding) This is serious!!
669	REX	Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
670	MR. POTATO HEAD	He's lyin'.  Buzz ain't there.
671	WOODY	(forced casualness) Oh, hi Buzz!  Why don't you say "hello" to the guys over there?
672	WOODY	Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
673	REX	Hey look!  It's Buzz!
674	WOODY	(shaking the arm's hand) Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
675	HAMM	Something's screwy here.
676	WOODY	So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?        (as BUZZ) You bet.  Gimme a hug.
677	WOODY	(continued; as himself) Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
678	SLINKY	See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
679	MR. POTATO HEAD	Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
680	WOODY	Nothing.
681	HAMM	Oh, that is disgusting.
682	MR. POTATO HEAD	Murderer!
683	WOODY	No!  No, no, no, no!
684	MR. POTATO HEAD	You murdering dog!
685	WOODY	No, it's not what you think, I swear!
686	MR. POTATO HEAD	Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
687	WOODY	No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
688	MR. POTATO HEAD	(to the other toys) Come on.  Let's get out of here.
689	HAMM	Go back to your lives, citizens. Show's over.
690	WOODY	Come back!  Slink!  Slink, please! Please!  Listen to me!
691	WOODY	(continued) No!  No!  Come back!  SLI-I-I-INKYYY!!
692	WOODY	BUZZ!!
693	WOODY	Go away, you disgusting freaks!
694	WOODY	Alright back!  Back, you cannibals!
695	WOODY	He is still alive, and you're not gonna get him, you monsters!
696	WOODY	Hey?!  Hey, they fixed you!
697	WOODY	(continued) But -- but they're cannibals.  We saw them eat those other toys.
698	WOODY	Uh...sorry.  I...I thought that you were gonna...        (laughs nervously) ...you know, eat my friend.
699	WOODY	Hey!  No, no, wait!  Hey!  What's wrong?
700	SID'S MOM	Sid!
701	SID	Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
702	WOODY	Sid!!!
703	WOODY	Buzz!  C'mon, get up!  Buzz, you're...        (GRUNT) ...get up...
704	WOODY	Fine.  Let Sid trash you.  But don't blame me.
705	SID	It came!  It finally came!
706	SID	(reverently) The big one.
707	SID	(reading the rocket label) "Extremely dangerous.  Keep out of reach of children."  COOL...        (looks around) What am I gonna blow?  Man...hey, where's that wimpy cowboy doll?
708	SID	Yes!  I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.  Ha-ha.
709	SID	Oh, no...
710	SID	Aw, man...!
711	SID	(as Newscaster) Sid Phillips reporting.  Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site.  Tomorrow's forecast...
712	SID	Sunny.  Ha-ha-ha.  Sweet dreams.
713	MRS. DAVIS	I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
714	ANDY	(groggy) But what if we leave them behind?
715	MRS. DAVIS	Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
716	REX	(muffled) Aaaah!  I need air!
717	REX	(relieved) Aa-a-a-a-ah!        (COUGH)
718	MR. POTATO HEAD	Will you quit moving around?!
719	REX	I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
720	MR. POTATO HEAD	How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
721	REX	(following Potato Head) Everyone else was picked.
722	BO PEEP	Oh, Woody, if only you could see how much Andy misses you.
723	WOODY	Ps-s-s-s-t!  Psst!  Hey, Buzz!
724	WOODY	Hey!  Get over here and see if you can get this tool box off me.
725	WOODY	Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
726	BUZZ	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
727	WOODY	Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
728	BUZZ	Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
729	WOODY	Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
730	BUZZ	No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.        (looking at himself) You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
731	WOODY	Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
732	BUZZ	Yeah, right.
733	WOODY	No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
734	BUZZ	But why would Andy want me?
735	WOODY	Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
736	WOODY	(continued; depressed) As a matter of fact you're too cool. I mean -- I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure?  All I can do is...
737	WOODY	There's a snake in my boots!
738	WOODY	Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when he's got you?        (pause) I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket.
739	WOODY	Listen Buzz, forget about me.  You should get out of here while you can.
740	WOODY	Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
741	BUZZ	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
742	WOODY	Yes Sir!
743	WOODY	(strained) Come on, Buzz!  We can do it!
744	BUZZ	Woody!  It's the moving van.
745	WOODY	We've got to get out of here...NOW.
746	WOODY	C'mon, Buzz.
747	WOODY	(loud whisper) Alright.  Buzz!  Hey!  I'm out!
748	BUZZ	...almost        (GRUNT) ...there        (GRUNT) ...
749	WOODY	(nervous laugh)
750	SID	(in his sleep) I wanna ride the pony...
751	BUZZ	Woody!  Woody?!  Are you alright?!
752	WOODY	(punch-drunk) No, I'm fine...I'm okay...
753	SID	Oh, yeah!  Time for lift-off!
754	SID	TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!!
755	WOODY	Aaah!  Back!  Back!  Down!  Down!
756	WOODY	(out of breath; to himself) Okay, what do I do?  Come on Woody, think!
757	WOODY	Guys!
758	WOODY	No, no, no!  Wait!  Wait!  Listen! Please!  There's a good toy down there and he's -- he's going to be blown to bits in a few minutes all because of me.  I've gotta save him!        (pause) -- But I need your help.
759	WOODY	Please.  He's my friend.  He's the only one I've got.
760	WOODY	(to Babyface) Thank you.        (to the others) Okay.  I think I know what to do. We're going to have to break a few rules, but if it works, it'll help everybody.
761	SID	(as Astronaut) Houston to Mission Control.  Come in, Control.
762	SID	(continued) Launch pad is being constructed! Heh-heh.
763	WOODY	All right, listen up.  I need Pump Boy here -- Ducky here.  Legs?
764	WOODY	(continued; to Legs) You're with Ducky.        (to the others) RollerBob and I don't move till we get the signal.  Clear?
765	WOODY	Okay, let's move!
766	WOODY	Wind the frog!
767	WOODY	Wait for the signal.
768	WOODY	Go!!
769	HANNAH	I'll get it!
770	WOODY	Alright, let's go.
771	HANNAH	I'm coming!  I'm coming!
772	HANNAH	(annoyed) SCUD!!!
773	HANNAH	Stupid dog.
774	WOODY	Lean back!
775	SID	Uh, Mission Control...is the launchpad construction complete? --        (simulated static) Uh, Roger, rocket is now secured to guide wire.  We are currently obtaining the...ignition sticks. Countdown will commence momentarily. Stand by --        (simulated static)
776	WOODY	(to toys in the bush) Let's go!
777	SID	Hey, Mom?!  Where are the matches? Oh, oh, wait, here they are. Nevermind...
778	BUZZ	(loud whisper) Woody?!  Great!  Help me out of this thing!
779	WOODY	Shhhhhhh!
780	BUZZ	What?!
781	WOODY	(loud whisper) It's ok.  Everything's under control.
782	BUZZ	Woody?!  What are you doing?!
783	SID	Houston, all systems are go. Requesting permission to launch --        (spotting Woody) Hey!  How'd you get out here?
784	SID	Oh, well, you and I can have a cookout later.  Ha-ha-ha...
785	SID	Houston, do we have permission to launch? --        (simulated static) Uh, Roger, permission granted.  You are confirmed at T minus 10 seconds...
786	SID	(continued) ...and counting.  Ten!  Nine! Eight!  Seven!  Six!  Five!  Four! Three!  Two!... One!...
787	WOODY	Reach for the sky!!
788	SID	Huh?
789	WOODY	This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
790	SID	What?!
791	WOODY	Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
792	SID	It's busted.
793	WOODY	Who are you callin' busted, Buster?!
794	WOODY	(continued) That's right.  I'm talking to YOU, Sid Phillips.  We don't like being blown up, Sid, or smashed, or ripped apart...
795	SID	W-w-w-we?
796	WOODY	That's right.        (beat) Your toys.
797	WOODY	From now on, you must take good care of your toys.  Because if you don't, we'll find out, Sid.  We toys can see...
798	WOODY	(continued) ...everything.
799	WOODY	(regular voice) So play nice.
800	SID	AAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!
801	SID	The toys!  The toys are alive!
802	SID	(continued) N-N-Nice dolly...
803	HAMM	What's wrong, Sid?!  Don't you want to play with Sally?!
804	WOODY	Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
805	BUZZ	Woody!
806	BUZZ	Thanks.
807	MRS. DAVIS	Everybody say, "Bye, house."
808	ANDY	(depressed) Bye, house.
809	BUZZ	Woody!  The van!
810	WOODY	(to mutant toys) We gotta run!  Thanks, guys.
811	WOODY	Quick!
812	BUZZ	Just go!  I'll catch up!
813	BUZZ	Come on!
814	BUZZ	You can do it, Woody.
815	WOODY	Whew, I made it!
816	WOODY	(kicking Scud with        other foot) Aaaaaahh!!  Get away, you stupid dog!  Down!  Down!
817	BUZZ	Hold on, Woody!
818	WOODY	I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!

890	WOODY	Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!        (rubbing his neck) There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
891	BO PEEP	Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
892	WOODY	Say, isn't that mistletoe?
893	BO PEEP	Mm-hmmmmm.
894	REX	(to Slinky) Maybe Andy'll get another dinosaur, like a leaf-eater.  That way, I could play the, uh, dominant predator.  Ha ha ha!
895	BUZZ	Quiet everyone, quiet!
896	SARGENT	(over monitor) Molly's first present i-i-is...Mrs. Potato Head.  Repeat.  A Mrs. Potato Head.
